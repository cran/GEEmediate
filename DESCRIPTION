Title: Mediation Analysis for Generalized Linear Models Using the
        Difference Method
Authors@R: person("Daniel", "Nevo", email = "danielnevo@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Causal mediation analysis for a single exposure/treatment and a
    single mediator, both allowed to be either continuous or binary. The package
    implements the difference method and provides point and interval estimates as
    well as testing for the natural direct and indirect effects and the mediation
    proportion. Nevo, Xiao and Spiegelman (2017) <doi:10.1515/ijb-2017-0006>.
